A long time ago, Kaguya Otsutsuki came to earth to devour the planet. Instead, she fell in love with a human. Though the planet ultimately did not suit her, her children passed on the ninja abilities that would become commonplace centuries later.

As the literal birth-family of ninja, the Otsutsuki clan are powerful. While they can be outmaneuvered and outnumbered, their raw power is unmatched. They may not have some of the powerful Kekkei Genkai of other clans, mutated over time, but they are still the source. Any member of this clan is a fierce foe. All ninja should fear their natural prowess in battle.
