Though the Hyuga clan starts off mysterious and vague, over time fans learn how truly powerful they can be. When their clan power is so coveted that they curse most all family members, there's genuine and fearsome power there. Neji showed off the damage even a young Hyuga can do during his time in the Chunin Exams. In the years afterwards, he and Hinata only continue to show off that strength.

While there are more powerful eyes out there, the Hyuga's Byakugan succeeds as a catch-all ability that can make anyone a stronger healer, scout, combatant, and more. The Byakugan is not something to take lightly, as its versatility is invaluable. Every member of the family is intense and powerful in their own way.
