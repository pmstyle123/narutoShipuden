When the first Hokage hails from a certain clan, of course, that family will be very powerful. Before Konoha was created, the area had two particular warring clans: The Senju and the Uchiha.  Haunted by losing family members to war and in-fighting, Hashirama Senju decided to create a village where ninja could learn and live in peace.

As direct descendants of Asura Otsutsuki, they control one of the purest bloodlines to the source of ninja abilities. Specializing in wood release, healing, and possessing strong chakra, they are an impressive family. Both the First and Fifth Hokage were of Senju blood. Not only do they have inherent powers, but they have honor and dedication that makes them even stronger.
