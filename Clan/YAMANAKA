The Yamanaka clan makes up one-third of the traditional Ino-Shika-Cho trio. While the “Shika” and “Cho” parts of the trio are more about physical abilities, using shadows and strength to manipulate opponents, the “Ino” part of the trio uses their mind.

The Yamanaka clan is able to use their minds to control their opponents, to communicate telepathically, and more. They might not be as physically strong as their teammates, but mentally, they’re some of the toughest shinobi to beat.
