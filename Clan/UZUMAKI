Fans could never discuss powerful clans without mentioning the iconic Uzumaki. Not only did they lead to Naruto Uzumaki, Kurama's host and the Seventh Hokage. This clan was known for not only their intense chakra reserves but also for being the infamous Nine-Tailed Fox's jinchuriki. Their oldest known member, Mito Uzumaki, was the beautiful and impressive wife of Hashirama Senju. She was the first to save her city from Kurama, but not the last.

While the previous bold red hair may be extremely rare now, Naruto and Boruto carry the name proudly. They may not be Uchiha levels of overall power, but they've created some powerful ninja over the years that have changed Konoha for the better.
