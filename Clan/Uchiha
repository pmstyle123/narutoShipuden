While fans can go on and on about the Naruto and Sasuke debate, there's no debate when it comes to overall clan strength. The Uchiha clan is by far the most powerful. The Sharingan alone gives them base abilities beyond most ninja. With that power comes an even more dangerous volatility, the Uchiha Curse. Their capacity for hatred is terrible.

Though they can become intimidatingly powerful, their best abilities come at a high cost. For example, the Mangekyo Sharingan is only activated by the user witnessing the passing of someone close to them. Worse, the eye only stabilizes by taking the eye of a fellow Uchiha. Horrible, huh?

Despite this, they still have the greatest capacity for power, making them the strongest clan in Naruto.
